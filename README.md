# Vowel Counter

This project is a simple vowel counter implemented as an HTML website. It takes a string as input and returns the number of vowels it contains. For the purposes of this project, 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u' are considered vowels, and all other letters are considered consonants.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sparsh1909/vowel-counter-html-website.git
```
